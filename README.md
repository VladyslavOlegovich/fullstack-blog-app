Currently, I am working on a fullstack project, which is a blog. 
To start the server, you need to run the database. You can do this using an Apache server. 
Here are the fields you need to include in the .env file located in the backend folder:
DB_HOST=your_DB_host
DB_USER=your_DB_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_DB_password
DB_NAME=your_DB_name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=your_port
